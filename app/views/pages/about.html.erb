          <p>My name is Brian Anderson, and I'm excited to begin my Development career! I chose to get into programming because I've always been passionate about building things! Growing up I've always been involved with woodworking and decided to put this love for building into code.</p>

          <p>I've been married for a little over a year. Some of the things I really enjoy are snowboarding in the winter, longboarding in the summer, watching and playing basketball year round and if I have any time after that I also love video games.</p>

          <p>I also started my own small smoothie company called The Juice Box Hero. In doing so I've learned a lot about how hard you need to work to get something out of nothing. I apply this mindset in everything I do. I love working hard whether that's independently or in group settings. If you have any questions I'd love to hear from you!</p>
