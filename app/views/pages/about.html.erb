          <p>My name is Brian Anderson. I chose to get into coding because I've always been passionate about building things! I chose Marketing Automation because I get to combine my love for coding with Marketing, which is pretty unusual I know, but it's something I've found I really enjoy!</p>

          <p>I've been married for about 4 years and recently had the most beautiful little daughter. I'm a huge Utah Jazz fan, I love movies, snowboarding, longboarding, Disneyland, traveling and video games. If I have extra free time I'll be figuring out a new coding feature or just chillin with my little fam. </p>

          <p>I also started my own small smoothie company called The Juice Box Hero. In doing so I've learned a lot about how hard you need to work to get something out of nothing. I apply this mindset in everything I do. I love working hard whether that's independently or in group settings. If you have any questions I'd love to hear from you!</p>
